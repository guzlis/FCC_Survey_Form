# FCC_Survey_Form
My first Certification project. Part of Freecodecamp's "Responsive Web Design" course.

This project aims to demonstrate the knowledge I have acquired so far (HTML, Basic CSS, CSS colors and HTML forms).


Establishing a proper workflow caused me the most difficulties, since I could not decide on whether I should first complete the HTML and THEN focus on the CSS, or If I should work on both simultaneously. For future projects, I think I will work on both simultaneously.
